### Our lab are working in Pillar II of the GDI and leading activity 3 described below.

---

In Ireland, the programme is jointly funded by the European Commission and the [Health Research Board](https://www.hrb.ie/). The overall programme is designed to support the European 1+ Million Genomes (1+MG) Initiative. Specifically, GDI will drive the development, deployment and operation of sustainable data-access infrastructures within each participating country including the legal frameworks, operational procedures and ethics principles required to foster and maintain citizens’ trust in cross-border access to highly sensitive personal data. It will unlock a data network of over 1 million genome sequences for research and clinical reference creating unprecedented opportunities for routine transnational, multi-stakeholder actions in personalised medicine for common, rare and infectious diseases. Authorised data users, such as clinicians, researchers and innovators, will be able to advance our understanding of genomics for more precise and faster clinical decision-making, diagnostics, treatments and predictive medicine, and for improved public health measures that will benefit citizens, healthcare systems and the overall economy. Thus, GDI is a critical component of Europe’s ambition to lead the integration of genomics into healthcare and the GDI project is designed to interact with the other actors working towards this ambition via incremental milestones that drive alignment along a dynamic roadmap.

GDI will lay the foundations for Ireland’s participation in a federated European Infrastructure for genomic data via six related areas of activities;

__Activity 1__: Promoting the establishment of the Irish 1+MG National Mirror Group, connecting with and contributing to the European 1+MG initiative. The Irish group will mirror the European-level working groups of the 1+MG, and to connect the relevant Irish-based individuals with those European working groups.

__Activity 2__: Developing a national genomics plan for realisation in Ireland of the European 1+MG initiative. This activity would seek to align with the National Strategy for Genetics and Genomics in Ireland, and scope out an impactful and sustainable Irish Genome Project.

__Activity 3__: Developing, testing and validating a proof of concept platform for performing distributed analysis, connected to the European Data Network. This would in effect be a pilot Irish node for the federated European system, connecting genomic datasets. __UL and the Culhane group are leading activity 3.__

__Activity 4__: Determining the Irish-specific data governance system needed to enable sustainable and secure sharing of genomic data. This will involve developing data governance practices for privacy protection in a data sharing/federated data environment. It will include public and patient involvement.

__Activity 5__: Feasibility study for cross-border (N:S) “Genomes of Ireland” initiative. This will inform a national genomic reference for Ireland.

__Activity 6__: Development of training initiatives for the next generation of genomic clinician and data scientists. This will develop training modules/activities that inform clinicians and data scientists, and equip them with the skills and knowledge required to enable safe and effective sharing of genomic data.

GDI-Ireland is co-led by Prof. Gianpiero Cavalleri (RCSI) and Prof. Denis Shields (UCD). They are joined by co-investigators Prof. Aedin Culhane (University of Limerick) and Prof. Markus Helfert (Maynooth Univerity). The team is assisted by collaborators at University of Galway, UCD, IPPOSI and Health Research Charities Ireland. The project will be governed by a group with cross sectorial (including patient/citizen) representation.

### Building on the EU 1+Million Genome initiative

The [1+MG initiative](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/1-million-genomes) was signed in 2018 and aims to enable secure access to genomics and corresponding clinical data across Europe to provide better research, personalised healthcare and health policymaking. The [Beyond 1 Million Genomes (B1MG)](https://b1mg-project.eu/) project started in 2020 and is developing guidelines for implementing the 1+MG Initiative and creating blueprints and recommendations for creating federated networks of genomic data. Building on the preparatory work of both of these, the [GDI project](https://gdi.onemilliongenomes.eu/news/) brings 20 EU Member States together with two infrastructure organisations (BBMRI and EMBL) to work collectively to support the 1+MG Initiative’s vision.
