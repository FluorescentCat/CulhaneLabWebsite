### CAR-T Cell Therapy in Kidney Cancer

Metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (mccRCC) patients have poor 5-year overall survival rate and there is an urgent need to develop therapeutics for these patients. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, which reprograms a patientâ€™s immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. Whilst CAR T-cell therapy has been used sucesffully in blood cancer it has not been translated to the solid tumors. The project goal is to develop CAR-T cell therapy in kidney cancer by fine-tuning immune CAR-T cells to recognize and eliminate only cancer cells but not the normal cells.

We are analyzing scRNAseq and multi omics single cell data generated as part of this project by Dr Yufei Wang and Prof Wayne Marasco in [The Marasco Laboratory](https://marascolab.dana-farber.org/) in the Department of Cancer Immunology and Virology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
