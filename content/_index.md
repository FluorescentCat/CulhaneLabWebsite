description: "Data is revolutionizing how we diagnose and treat cancer. Advances in sequencing allow us to spatially map and measure and the genome, transcriptome and other multi-omics of each individual single cell in a tumor. These data allow us to build a map of tumor architecture, profile the cells within the tumor and its microenviroment, understand cell-cell interactions and identify new targets for diagnosis and treatment."
